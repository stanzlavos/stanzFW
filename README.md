A template UI/Touch enabled workspace/framework for ESP8266 based projects

The intention behind this work is two fold :

1) Provide a template arduino workspace for ESP8266 related projects
2) Provide a touch integrated GUI framework so that adding a UI to a project becomes easy

The UI logic itself is independent of the hardware. It should work with any other arduino compatible HW I suppose. Currently tested on NodeMCU ESP8266-12E and Wemos D1 Mini.

## Notes :

* I will be working on this project as and when I get time. :) There are definitely many more activities planned.
* I will try to add a video showing the capabilities at the earliest.
* I am not sure how fast I will be able to respond to issues, but I definitely will.
* You can always support me by making contributions : [Support Me !!!](https://www.paypal.me/stanzlavos)
