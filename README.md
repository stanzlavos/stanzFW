A template UI/Touch enabled workspace/framework for ESP8266 based projects

The intention behind this work is two fold :

1) Provide a template arduino workspace for ESP8266 related projects
2) Provide a touch integrated GUI framework so that adding a UI to a project becomes easy

The UI logic itself is independent of the hardware. It should work with any other arduino compatible HW I suppose.
